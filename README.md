The Questionnaires and Solutions (Codes) are provided in the Repository.

Assignment 1 was a subjective, theoretical, and non-coding assignment that was left out of the repository.

Assignment 2: Uses Prior Assumptions and Data-generated Likelihood Functions to Generate the Posterior Distribution.

Assignment 3: Methods like Grid Estimation, Analytical Inference, Monte Carlo Integration, Markov's Chain, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Estimation are used to generate posterior distributions.

Assignment 4: Uses Linear Regression and Poisson Regression to estimate parameters of the probability distribution functions.
